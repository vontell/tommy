# Tommy

Tommy is a pure JavaScript-based speech navigation system for websites. It focuses on providing easy page-to-page speech navigation in a highly-readable way.

## Installation

## Quick Example

## Full API

In it's most basic form, Tommy works by keeping track of a set of **definitions**, which it uses to generate **suggestions** to the user. When Tommy is given a **payload** from the user (either from typed text or spoken speech), it processes this payload and then finds relevant suggestions by finding defitions which have matching keywords. Simple, right?

When giving Tommy a set of defintions, you can provide the most basic items (shown in the Quick Example above), which is simply a path, keywords, title, and description (in fact, you can even omit most of these; more on that later).
